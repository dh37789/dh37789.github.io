# 조인

## 종류

- 내부 조인: `SELECT m FROM Member m [INNER] JOIN m.team t`
- 외부 조인: `SELECT m FROM Member m LEFT [OUTER] JOIN m.team t`
- 세타 조인: `select count(m) from Member m, Team t where m.username = t.name`

> 세타 조인은 연관관계가 없는 엔티티를 카티션 프로덕트로 모두 가져오는 조인

## 예시

### inner join

```java
Team team = new Team();
team.setName("teamA");
entityManager.persist(team);

Member member = new Member();
member.setUsername("member");
member.setAge(10);
member.setTeam(team);
entityManager.persist(member);

/* inner는 생략이 가능하다. */
/* String query = "select m from Member m inner join m.team t"; */
String query = "select m from Member m join m.team t";
List<Member> result = entityManager.createQuery(query, Member.class)
        .getResultList();
```

```shell
/* select
        m
    from
        Member m
    inner join
        m.team t */ select
            member0_.id as id1_0_,
            member0_.age as age2_0_,
            member0_.TEAM_ID as team_id4_0_,
            member0_.username as username3_0_
        from
            Member member0_
        inner join
            Team team1_
                on member0_.TEAM_ID=team1_.id
```

### left outer join

```java
/* outer을 생략이 가능하다. */
/* String query = "select m from Member m left outer join m.team t"; */
String query = "select m from Member m left join m.team t";
List<Member> result = entityManager.createQuery(query, Member.class)
        .getResultList();
```

```shell
/* select
        m
    from
        Member m
    left outer join
        m.team t */ select
            member0_.id as id1_0_,
            member0_.age as age2_0_,
            member0_.TEAM_ID as team_id4_0_,
            member0_.username as username3_0_
        from
            Member member0_
        left outer join
            Team team1_
                on member0_.TEAM_ID=team1_.id
```

### 세타 조인

```java
String query = "select m from Member m, Team t where m.username = t.name";
List<Member> result = entityManager.createQuery(query, Member.class)
        .getResultList();
```

```shell
/* select
        m
    from
        Member m,
        Team t
    where
        m.username = t.name */ select
            member0_.id as id1_0_,
            member0_.age as age2_0_,
            member0_.TEAM_ID as team_id4_0_,
            member0_.username as username3_0_
        from
            Member member0_ cross
        join
            Team team1_
        where
            member0_.username=team1_.name
```

## 조인 - ON절

- ON절을 활용한 조인 (JPA 2.1부터 지원 하지만 대게 2.1 이상을 사용한다..)

### 1. 조인 대상 필터링

- 예) 회원과 팀을 조인하면서, 팀 이름이 A인 팀만 조인

> JPQL: SELECT m, t FROM Member m LEFT JOIN m.team t on t.name = 'A'
> SQL: SELECT m.*, t.* FROM Member m LEFT JOIN Team t ON m.TEAM_ID=t.id and t.name='A'

```java
String query = "select m from Member m left outer join m.team t on t.name = 'teamA'";
List<Member> result = entityManager.createQuery(query, Member.class)
        .getResultList();
```

```shell
/* select
        m
    from
        Member m
    left outer join
        m.team t
            on t.name = 'teamA' */ select
                member0_.id as id1_0_,
                member0_.age as age2_0_,
                member0_.TEAM_ID as team_id4_0_,
                member0_.username as username3_0_
        from
            Member member0_
        left outer join
            Team team1_
                on member0_.TEAM_ID=team1_.id
                and (
                    team1_.name='teamA'
                )
```

and 조건에 추가로 teamA라는 조건식이 추가되는 것을 확인 할 수있다.

### 2. 연관관계 없는 엔티티 외부 조인

- 예) 회원의 이름과 팀의 이름이 같은 대상 외부 조인

> JPQL: SELECT m, t FROM Member m LEFT JOIN Team t on m.username = t.name
> SQL: SELECT m.*, t.* FROM Member m LEFT JOIN Team t ON m.username = t.name

```java
String query = "select m from Member m left join Team t on m.username = t.name";
List<Member> result = entityManager.createQuery(query, Member.class)
        .getResultList();
```

```shell
/* select
        m
    from
        Member m
    left join
        Team t
            on m.username = t.name */ select
                member0_.id as id1_0_,
                member0_.age as age2_0_,
                member0_.TEAM_ID as team_id4_0_,
                member0_.username as username3_0_
        from
            Member member0_
        left outer join
            Team team1_
                on (
                    member0_.username=team1_.name
                )
```

on 절에 추가한 조건식이 들어가는 것을 확인 할 수 있다.
